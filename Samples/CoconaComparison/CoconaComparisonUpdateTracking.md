# Cocona Comparison Document Update Tracking

This document tracks which Cocona comparison documents need updates to match the standard template structure defined in `CoconaComparisonTemplate.md`.

## Standard Template Sections

The standard template includes these sections in order:
1. Title and introduction
2. Overview
3. Side-by-Side Comparison
4. Key Differences
5. Usage Examples
6. Architecture Insights
7. Performance Considerations
8. Developer Experience
9. Migration Guide
10. Additional Notes (optional)

## Documents Status

### ✅ Fully Compliant Documents

These documents follow the standard template structure:

1. **minimal-app.md**
   - All standard sections present
   - Good example of the template in practice

2. **subcommand-app.md**
   - All standard sections present
   - Includes comprehensive migration notes

3. **typical-simple-app.md**
   - All standard sections present
   - Well-structured with clear sections

### ⚠️ Documents Needing Updates

#### app-configuration.md

**Missing Sections:**
- Architecture Insights
- Developer Experience
- Migration Guide (has "Migration Notes" but not a full guide)

**Non-standard Sections:**
- Has "Evaluation" section instead of standard conclusion

**Recommended Updates:**
1. Add "Architecture Insights" section comparing:
   - Cocona's Host Builder pattern
   - Nuru's explicit configuration approach
2. Add "Developer Experience" section covering:
   - Configuration setup complexity
   - IDE support and IntelliSense
   - Debugging configuration issues
3. Expand "Migration Notes" into full "Migration Guide"
4. Consider integrating "Evaluation" content into other sections

#### command-filter.md

**Missing Sections:**
- Architecture Insights
- Developer Experience  
- Migration Guide

**Non-standard Sections:**
- Has "Output Example" section (unique to this document)
- Has "Evaluation" section instead of Migration Guide

**Recommended Updates:**
1. Add "Architecture Insights" section comparing:
   - Cocona's attribute-based filter architecture
   - Nuru's Mediator pipeline architecture
2. Add "Developer Experience" section covering:
   - How to debug filters/behaviors
   - Testing strategies
   - Common patterns
3. Replace "Evaluation" with proper "Migration Guide" showing:
   - How to convert CommandFilter attributes to Pipeline Behaviors
   - Mapping filter registration patterns
   - Handling filter ordering
4. Keep "Output Example" as it's valuable for this specific feature

## Action Items

1. **High Priority**: Update `app-configuration.md` to include missing standard sections
2. **High Priority**: Update `command-filter.md` to include missing standard sections
3. **Future**: As new comparison documents are created, ensure they follow `CoconaComparisonTemplate.md`
4. **Nice to Have**: Consider adding a "Common Patterns" or "Best Practices" section to the template if patterns emerge

## Notes

- The "Output Example" section in `command-filter.md` is actually valuable and should be retained even though it's not in the standard template
- Some variation is acceptable when it adds value to understanding the specific feature being compared
- The goal is consistency in core sections while allowing flexibility for feature-specific additions
