# [Feature Name]: Cocona vs Nuru Comparison

This document compares the implementation of [brief description] between Cocona and Nuru frameworks.

## Overview

The [Feature Name] demonstrates:
- [Key feature 1]
- [Key feature 2]
- [Key feature 3]
- [Additional features as needed]

Nuru provides two approaches:
1. **Delegate-based** (`[sample-name]`) - Direct lambda expressions for maximum performance
2. **Class-based with DI** (`[sample-name-di]`) - Mediator pattern with dependency injection, closer to Cocona's model

## Side-by-Side Comparison

### Cocona Implementation

```csharp
// Cocona code example
```

### Nuru Implementation (Delegate)

```csharp
// Nuru delegate-based code example
```

### Nuru Implementation (Class-based with DI)

```csharp
// Nuru class-based code example with DI
```

## Key Differences

### 1. [Difference Category 1]
- **Cocona**: [How Cocona handles it]
- **Nuru (Delegate)**: [How Nuru delegate approach handles it]
- **Nuru (Class-based)**: [How Nuru class-based approach handles it]

### 2. [Difference Category 2]

### 3. [Additional categories as needed]

## Usage Examples

All implementations support the same command-line interface:

```bash
# Example 1
./app [command] [args] [options]
# Output: [expected output]
