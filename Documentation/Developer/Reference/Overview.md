# Reference Documentation

Technical specifications and standards that developers consult while working.

This section contains:
- Coding standards and conventions
- API documentation and specifications
- Configuration schemas and options
- Command-line references
- Technical constraints and requirements

Reference documentation is designed for quick lookup rather than sequential reading. It should be accurate, complete, and consistently structured to help developers find specific information efficiently.
