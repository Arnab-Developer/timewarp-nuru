# Research Roslyn-Based Type Inspection MCP Tool

## Description

Research and design a Roslyn-powered MCP (Model Context Protocol) tool that can provide deep type inspection and analysis capabilities for .NET assemblies and NuGet packages. The tool should leverage Roslyn's compile-time analysis capabilities to provide richer information than traditional reflection-based approaches, focusing on making .NET type exploration accessible to AI agents through the MCP protocol.

## Background

During development discussions, we explored the possibility of using Roslyn to expose detailed type information through MCP, considering:
- Whether Roslyn could provide superior depth compared to LSP for static analysis
- Generic applicability across any .NET library (not just TimeWarp.Nuru)
- Potential synergies with existing NuGet package exploration tools
- Discovery that existing NuGet MCP servers already provide some of this functionality

## Requirements

- [ ] Evaluate existing solutions (NuGet MCP, NuGet Package Explorer)
- [ ] Identify gaps in current type inspection tooling
- [ ] Design Roslyn-based type analysis architecture
- [ ] Consider integration points with existing MCP ecosystem
- [ ] Assess performance implications of compile-time vs runtime analysis
- [ ] Define clear value proposition compared to existing tools

## Research Questions

### Technical Feasibility
- [ ] Can Roslyn provide meaningful advantages over reflection for type inspection?
- [ ] What specific Roslyn features would benefit MCP integration?
- [ ] Performance characteristics of compile-time vs runtime analysis?

### Integration Considerations
- [ ] How does this complement existing NuGet MCP server?
- [ ] Opportunities for collaboration vs duplication?
- [ ] Potential for shared tooling or API design patterns?

### Use Cases and Value
- [ ] What specific scenarios would benefit from Roslyn analysis?
- [ ] How does this differ from runtime reflection approaches?
- [ ] Target audience (developers, AI agents, tool builders)?

## Implementation Considerations

### Roslyn Integration
- [ ] Assembly loading strategies for NuGet packages
- [ ] Symbol analysis for deep type hierarchy exploration
- [ ] Performance optimization for on-demand analysis
- [ ] Error handling for malformed assemblies

### MCP Protocol Design
- [ ] Tool interface design following MCP conventions
- [ ] Resource organization and discovery patterns
- [ ] Incremental analysis capabilities
- [ ] Caching strategies for large assemblies

## Success Criteria

- [ ] Clear understanding of Roslyn's advantages for MCP integration
- [ ] Detailed design specification for potential implementation
- [ ] Identified integration points with existing MCP tools
- [ ] Performance and feasibility analysis complete

## Notes

### Discussion Summary
- **Initial Idea**: Use Roslyn for deep static analysis to expose type information via MCP
- **LSP Limitations**: LSP works for IDE scenarios but may not be optimal for comprehensive library analysis
- **Existing Tools Discovery**: Found that NuGet MCP servers already exist with type inspection capabilities
- **Current Resolution**: Added NuGet MCP to Roo for immediate exploration capabilities

### Next Steps
This research will help determine whether to:
1. **Extend Existing Tools** - Enhance current NuGet MCP with Roslyn capabilities
2. **Build Custom Tool** - Create specialized Roslyn inspector with unique features
3. **Collaborate** - Work with existing tool maintainers to add requested features
